# BombusCanadaSpatialAnalysis 🐝
Spatial analysis based on Bombus of Canada dataset. 

## Dataset - Bombus of Canada
This project uses the [Dataset: Bombus of Canada]([link-to-dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/84750258-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a)) dataset.

### Description

Bumble bee data transcribed from specimen labels; latitude and longitude added to database subsequently. 16088 records from Bombus of Canada. 

## Research Questions

1. How many bumble bee species found in North America are present in British Columbia?
2. Is the point process homogeneous? If not, what covariates are related to its intensity?
3. What does the Poisson point process model look like?
4. How do Forest Cover, Elevation, and HFI spatially structure Bombus habitats based on autocorrelation analysis?

## Methods

- Spatial visulization
- Quadrat Map
- CSR Test & Kernel-based Hotspots.
- Poisson point process modeling
- Likelihood ratio tests

## Conclusion

1. 984 unique occurrences in BC province – Accounting for 75 % (30 species) of the total species found in North America (40 species).
2. Bombus are clustered in southern BC, especially in low to mid elevations and moderately forested areas. This pattern is largely explained by environmental covariates, with little additional spatial clustering beyond that.
3. Incorporating quadratic terms and interactions between variables improves the fit of the Poisson point process model for bumble bee distribution.
4. Bombus species demonstrate a distinct preference for forested habitats while exhibiting remarkable adaptability to anthropogenic landscapes, maintaining their ecological dependence on forest ecosystems.
